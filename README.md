# Hi! Welcome to my GitHub  
**Android Engineer focused on Clean Architecture, scalable architecture, and secure mobile solutions.**  
I build Android apps with strong fundamentals: MVVM, modularization, testing mindset, and practical problem-solving.

## ⭐ Main Projects (Architecture & System Design)

### 📊 [PluggableAnalytics](https://github.com/CaiioLima/PluggableAnalytics)

A pluggable analytics system for Android designed to avoid SDK coupling.  
The application communicates only with an abstraction layer, allowing providers like Firebase or custom analytics to be swapped without modifying the application code.  
Demonstrates **dependency inversion, modularization and scalable architecture for large apps**.
